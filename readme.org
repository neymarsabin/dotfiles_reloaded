	- *dots* -> has all the configuration for the apps I am using
	- *scripts* -> this folder makes Arch Linux usable

* How To?
- symlink essentials like ~i3config~, ~tmux~ etc into $HOME directory. I am not going to write commands to do symlinks here!!
- I am using ~Doom Emacs~, export ~$DOOMDIR~ environment variable in your .zshrc
- I recommend setting up ~.zshrc~ with ~oh-my-zsh~ if you want to have themes and plugins written and maintained by awesome people

* Laptop and OS
- Lenovo Thinkpad e14 ryzen 7 with AMD Graphics [linux works much better in AMD processors]
- Arch Linux with ~pacman~ and ~yay~ package managers

* Apps and Dependencies
- i3 window manager [ best if you are working with multiple monitors and use less mouse ]
- EMACS [ emacs-nativecomp in terminal, the GUI is not working ]
- alacritty + tmux [ alacritty has config file, tmux is awesome ]
- rofi [ replacing dmenu for everything - commands, windows, clipboard ]
- xclip and greenclip [ xclip is native clipboard manager of X11 and greenclip is too good with rofi ]
- mplayer [ I don't use this very much ]
- scrot for screenshots [ ~scrot -s <date>.png~ ]
- ranger [ terminal file manager, plus supports vim motions ]
- firefox [ only because it has vimium ]

* TODOs for fridays
- [ ] bluetooth mouse is not working, fix this for Arch Linux
- [ ] have screen tearing, I don't care much about this yet, till I get irritated
- [ ] fix EMACS GUI version
- [ ] thinkpad - tap to click is not working
